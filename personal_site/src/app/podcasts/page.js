      <p>
        5 Questions is the show where I interview activists, lawyers, writers,
        musicians and so many others to reveal the personal stories and lives of
        incredible people who work every day to improve the lives of those
        around them through their work and outspokenness through 5 simple
        questions.

      <p>
        In Silent Journeys, guests have the opportunity to share their own
        journeys with mental health. This project aims to contribute to the
        ongoing and necessary dialogue that normalizes discussion of mental
        health and brings into focus that we all have our own struggles at times
        and that&apos;s ok.
